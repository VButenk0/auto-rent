## Features

This app serves as a car rental catalog. Here, users can browse cars available for rent, filter them, add them to their favorites, and, of course, rent a car.

### Catalog

This is the catalog page, where the user sees the cars available for rent and information about them.

There are three types of filters for a more accurate search for the right car.

#### Filter by car brand

#### Learn more

If there is not enough information about the car displayed in the catalog, you can learn more about it by clicking the "Learn more" button.

This will open a modal window with more information about the car.

And at the bottom of the window, there is a "Rental car" button that allows the user to immediately contact the renter.
